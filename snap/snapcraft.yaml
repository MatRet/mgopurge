summary: Cleanup Mongo databases managed by mgo/txn
description: |
    This runs several steps to handle known issues with mgo/txn. Specifically things like:
        * transaction ids referenced by documents but the transaction itself is missing.
        * transaction queues growing too long
        * being able to cleanup transactions that have been applied from the txns collection.
